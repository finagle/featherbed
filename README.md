Featherbed aims to be a typesafe, functional REST client API over [Finagle](https://github.com/twitter/finagle).
It provides a friendlier approach to building REST client interfaces in Scala.  Currently, Featherbed
is in the early stages of development, and includes the following modules:

 1. `featherbed-core` - the functional client interface
 2. `featherbed-circe` - automatic JSON request encoding and response decoding using [circe](https://github.com/travisbrown/circe)

The following modules are planned:

 1. `featherbed-oauth` - OAuth authenticated requests
